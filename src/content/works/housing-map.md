Based on my own past experiences at searching for rental properties online, I want to improve the
user experience for people searching through property listings online. I am currently developing a
website that utilises TradeMe API endpoints to show available listings in a more digestible way, when compared to existing solutions.

Currently, the website is in the early stages of development. I am using NextJS for the frontend, and TailwindCSS for styling. The Google Maps API is used to display the location of each listing on a map. The TradeMe API is used to fetch the listings.

The website will allow users to filter listings based on their preferences, such as price range, number of bedrooms, and location. Users will also be able to view the location of each listing on a map, and view more details about each listing.

You can check out the current deployment of the website [here](https://trademe-housing.vercel.app/).
