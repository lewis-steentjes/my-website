Inspired by the challenges of online property hunting, I'm building a tool to enhance the user experience. By integrating TradeMe listings with Google Maps, my aim is to let users scan a map and quickly grasp key details about available rentals.

**The Problem:** Popular platforms like [Homes.co.nz](https://homes.co.nz/) offer map views, but it can be tedious to glean important information (price, bedrooms, listing age) without constantly clicking individual listings.

##### **My Solution:**

- **Color-Coded Age:** Icons instantly convey how recent a listing is.
- **Price at a Glance:** No more clicking just to see if it's in your budget.
- **Informative Hover:** Essential details like bedrooms/bathrooms on mouseover.
- **Visual History:** Icons change after viewing, reducing re-clicks.

**The Goal:** A streamlined property search where map exploration reveals the information you need. Stay tuned as I continue to refine this project!
