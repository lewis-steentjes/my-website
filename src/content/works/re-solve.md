Re-Solve is a web application that allows users to create and solve coding puzzles. The idea behind the project was to create a platform where users could create coding puzzles, share them with others and give/recieve feedback. The puzzles are intended to be focused around improving code hygiene.

We had seven days to design, plan and complete the project. We used a combination of Agile and Scrum methodologies to manage our time and tasks. We used Git for version control, Auth0 for authentication, and DaisyUI with Tailwind for styling. The application was deployed using Dokku and is available at [re-solve.pushed.nz](https://re-solve.pushed.nz).
