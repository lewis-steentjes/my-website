I built this web site with [Astro!](https://astro.build/) The design was inspired by [Greg Chen's](https://www.guanbaic.com/) portfolio website. I wanted to create a simple, clean, and fast website that would allow me to easily write and publish content. Astro was the perfect choice for this, as it allowed me to write my content in Markdown, and easily include components for things like the hero image and tags.

The site is still a work in progress, but I'm excited to continue working on it and adding new features. I still need to work on the typography of the site, as well as my about page and some other things. I have made sure to create a responsive design that looks good and works on all devices, and I use the [WAVE](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) accessibility tool to ensure that the site is accessible to all users.
