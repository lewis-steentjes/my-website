This is my previous blog that I created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Zzossig's theme](https://github.com/zzossig/hugo-theme-zzo). I used this blog to learn the basics of Hugo, and to document my progress on various personal projects. I learned a lot about Hugo, Git, and Markdown while working on this blog, which I have transferred toward building this current website.

This project showed me the potential of static site generators, and inspired me to start working on my current website. I learned how to create and manage content using Markdown, how to use Git for version control, and how to deploy a static site using GitHub Pages. I also learnt how to use Hugo's templating system to create custom layouts and styles for my site.

Currently, you can still view the blog at [old-hugo-blog.netlify.app](https://old-hugo-blog.netlify.app/)
