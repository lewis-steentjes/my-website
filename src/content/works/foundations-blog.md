This is the blog I created during the foundational weeks of the Web Development bootcamp at the Dev Academy Aotearoa. The purpose of this blog was to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to document my progress as I learned. I used GitHub Pages to host the blog, and I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the site.

It's a simple blog with a clean design that allowed me to easily and clearly experiment with the basics of web development. I learned how to create and style HTML elements, how to use CSS to style the layout and design of the site, and how to use JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to the site.
