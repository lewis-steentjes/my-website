Re-Solve is a web application designed to help developers practice and improve their code hygiene through the creation and solving of coding puzzles. We built this platform as our final project for the Dev Academy Aotearoa bootcamp, aiming to provide a space for sharing knowledge and receiving constructive feedback on coding style.

##### **Features:**

- **Intuitive Puzzle Creation:** Design your own coding challenges that target specific code cleanliness principles.
- **Community-Driven Feedback:** Share your puzzles, solve those created by others, and provide valuable insights.
- **Focus on Code Hygiene:** Enhance your understanding of best practices for writing readable, maintainable, and efficient code.

##### **Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
- **Backend:** Express, SQL, Knex, Auth0,
- **Deployment:** Git, Dokku
- **Collaboration:** GitHub, Figma, Miro, Discord,

Taking Re-Solve from concept to a deployed application in just seven days was an incredibly rewarding challenge. This project solidified our teamwork skills and demonstrated our ability to learn and apply new technologies rapidly. The application was deployed using Dokku and is available as a demo at [re-solve.pushed.nz](https://re-solve.pushed.nz).
